Hello,
I'm EunAe Kim, and I'm aspiring to become a DevOps Engineer.

I started this blog to document my growth journey as a non-computer science major aiming for a DevOps engineering role. It's where I'll organize the knowledge I gain and build my portfolio. I plan to keep this blog updated consistently.

My main content will focus on preparing for certifications and summarizing concepts from DevOps-related books.

----------

Current Progress & Goals📚:
1. AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate certification preparation.

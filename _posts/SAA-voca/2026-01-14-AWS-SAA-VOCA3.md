- Provisioning : It is the process of setting up and allocating resources (like servers, storage, databases, etc.) so they're ready to use.

- Vertical Scaling : It means making a single server more powerful by adding more CPU, memory, or disk.

- Horizontal : It means adding more servers or nodes to handle traffic or load.

- Dynamically : Doing something automatically or in real-time, often based on conditions or changes, not hardcoded.

- Detects : To notice, find, or identify something — especially a change, error, or event in a system.

- Eventually : Something will happen later — not right now, but after some time or after some steps complete.

- Leverage : To use something effectively to get the best advantage or benefit from it.

- Failover : When a system automatically switches to a backup or secondary system if the main system fails.

- Intervention : When a person has to step in to take action, usually because something went wrong or the system can't fix it automatically.

- Disaster Recovery : A planned strategy to restore systems, data, and services after a major failure or disaster — like hardware failure, cyberattack, or natural disaster.

- Internally : Something happens inside a system or service, not exposed to the outside.

- Synchronization : Making sure that multiple systems, processes, or data sets are working together at the same time and are up to date with each other.

- Customization : Changing or adjusting a tool, service, or system to fit your specific needs or preferences.

- Underlying Database : The actual database system that is used behind the scenes to store and manage data — even if you're using a service that hides the technical details.

- Provisioning : It is the process of setting up and allocating resources (like servers, storage, databases, etc.) so they're ready to use.

- Vertical Scaling : It means making a single server more powerful by adding more CPU, memory, or disk.

- Horizontal : It means adding more servers or nodes to handle traffic or load.

- Dynamically : Doing something automatically or in real-time, often based on conditions or changes, not hardcoded.

- Detects : To notice, find, or identify something — especially a change, error, or event in a system.

- Eventually : Something will happen later — not right now, but after some time or after some steps complete.

- Leverage : To use something effectively to get the best advantage or benefit from it.

- Failover : When a system automatically switches to a backup or secondary system if the main system fails.

- Intervention : When a person has to step in to take action, usually because something went wrong or the system can't fix it automatically.

- Disaster Recovery : A planned strategy to restore systems, data, and services after a major failure or disaster — like hardware failure, cyberattack, or natural disaster.

- Internally : Something happens inside a system or service, not exposed to the outside.

- Synchronization : Making sure that multiple systems, processes, or data sets are working together at the same time and are up to date with each other.

- Customization : Changing or adjusting a tool, service, or system to fit your specific needs or preferences.

- Underlying Database : The actual database system that is used behind the scenes to store and manage data — even if you're using a service that hides the technical details.

- Instantaneous : Happening immediately, with no noticeable delay — it feels almost faster than real-time.

- Increments : Small steps or increases in amount, size, or value — usually done gradually or repeatedly.

- Peer-to-Peer : A network model where each device (peer) can communicate directly with other devices — without needing a central server.

- Stripe : In storage systems, a stripe is a way of splitting data across multiple drives to improve speed and performance.

- Fail-over : Automatically switching to a backup system when the main one fails.

- Recovery : The process of getting systems or data back after failure.

- Isolation : Keeping systems or environments separated to avoid problems spreading.

- Compliance : Following rules, laws, or standards (like security, data privacy).

- Zero Downtime : No service interruption during updates or failures.

- Advanced : More powerful or complex features beyond basic.

- Routine : Regular, scheduled processes or tasks.

- Maintenance : Work to keep systems running smoothly, like updates or checks.

- Restore data : To bring back lost or deleted data from a backup.

- Defining : To clearly set or describe something — like a setting, value, rule, or structure.

- Instantitation : The act of creating an instance of something — like a resource, class, or service.

- Infrequent : Happens rarely — not common or regular.

- Intermittent : Happens sometimes, not consistently — it comes and goes.

- Disaster : A major failure or unexpected event that causes serious service interruption or data loss.

- Interruption : A pause, break, or unexpected stop in a system, service, or process.

- Secondary : Something that is used as a backup or comes after the primary system.

- Pause : To temporarily stop something, with the option to resume later.

- Resume : To start again after something was paused or stopped.

- Integration : Connecting different systems or services so they can work together smoothly.

- Sentiment : The feeling or opinion expressed in text — like positive, negative, or neutral.

- Comprehend : A fully managed NLP (Natural Language Processing) service by AWS that can analyze and understand text.

- SageMaker : A machine learning platform to build, train, and deploy models at scale.

- Fraud Detection : Using AI or logic to find unusual or suspicious behavior, such as fake transactions or attacks.

- Babelfish : It is a feature of Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL that allows it to understand SQL Server commands — so you can run SQL Server applications on Aurora without rewriting all your code.

- Command : An instruction you give to a computer or system to do something — like run a program, create a file, or manage cloud resources.

- Retention : It usually means how long data is stored (kept) before it is deleted.

- Proxy : A middle helper that passes requests between a user and another server.

- Intensive : Uses a lot of resources (like CPU, memory, power, time).

- Retrieves : Gets something back (like data or files).

- Authentication : Checking who you are before giving access.

- Stale : Old and not fresh (usually for data or cache).

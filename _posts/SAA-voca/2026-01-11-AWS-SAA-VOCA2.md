- Scalability : The ability of a system, application, or infrastructure to handle increasing load (more users, more data, more traffic) by adding resources - without breaking or slowing down.

- Vertical Scalability : Increasing the power of a single server or resource by adding more CPU, memory (RAM), disk, or IOPS to handle more load.

- Horizontal : Adding more machines, servers, or instances to handle increased traffic or load.

- Elasticity : The ability of a system to automatically increase or decrease resources based on the current demand.

- Implies : Suggests or indicates something without saying it directly.

- Offerings : The products, services, or features that a company (like AWS) provides to customers.

- Passive : Something that does not actively do anything, but waits, observes, or responds only when needed.

- Expose : To make something visible or accessible to others - especially something that was hidden or private.

- Seamlessly : Doing something smoothly and without interruption,problems, or the user even noticing.

- Stickiness : Making sure a user always connects to the smae server or instance during a session - even when aa load balancer is used.

- Guarantees : A promise or assurance that something will happen in a certain way, with specific reliability or results.

- Knobs : Settings or configuration options that you can adjust (tune) to control how a system behaves.

- Configuration : The settings, options, and values that define how a system, application, or service behaves.

- Redirect : To send a request or user to a different location - such as a new URL, server, or resource.

- Dynamic port : A port number that is assigned automatically by the system or service at runtime, instead of being fixed.

- Ultra-low : Extremely low.

- Static : Something that is fixed, unchanging, or does not move or update automatically.

- Whitelist : A list of approved items or entities (like IP addresses, users, or domains) that are allowed access to a system, service, or resource.

- Imbalance : A lack of balance.

- Alternatively : Another option or choice.

- Legacy clients : Older software or systems (clients) that were built using outdated technology, but are still being used today.

- SSL handshake : A process where a client (like your browser) and a server ( like a website or API) agree on how to securely communicate using encryption.

- Older gen : Previous versions of hardware or software that have since been replaced by newer, more powerful options.

- Connection Draining : A process that allows exiting connections to finsh before removing or stopping a server (or instance) from the load balanceer.

- Deregistration Delay : The amount of time a load balancer waits before closing connections to a target (like an EC2 instance) after it's been removed from the target group.

- Metric : A measurable value that tells you how a system is performing or what's happening inside your application, infrastructure, or services.

- Scale-out : Adding more instances or nodes to a system to handle increased load.

- Anticipate : To expect something to happen before it actually does, and prepare for it in advance.

- Capacity : The maximum amount of something that a system or resource can handle, store, or proces.

- Utilization : How much of a resource you are using, compared to how much is available.

- Network bound : A system or process is limited by network speed or bandwidth, not by CPU or memory.

- Cooldown period : A waiting time after a scaling activity (like launching or terminating an instance), during which no other scaling actions can happen.

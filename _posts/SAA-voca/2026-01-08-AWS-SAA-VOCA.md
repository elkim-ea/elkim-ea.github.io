- Boot : To start up a computer or server so it begins working.

- Booting up : starting the machine.

- Hood : How something works inside.

- Encrypted : To protect data by running it into a secret code so that only people (or systems) with the correct key can used it.

- Initialize : To set something up for the first time so it's ready to be used.

- Persist data : To save data in a way that it doesen't get lost, even after the system is turned off or restarted.

- Termination : To permanently shut down and delete a resource.

- Mounted : Attaching storage (like a disk or volume) to a system so the system can use it like a folder.

- Bounding : Connected or linked to something so that they work together.

- Latency : The delay or waiting time between request and response.

- Detached : Disconnected or removed from something it was connected to.

- Provisioned : To set up, allocate or prepare resources so they're ready to use.

- Capacity : The maximum amount something can hold, handle, or support.

- Attribute : A specific piece of information or property about something.

- Preserve : To keep something safe, unchanged, and not lost or destroyed.

- Retain : To keep something not delete it, and hold onto it for future use.

- Recover : To get something back after it was lost, deleted, broken, or stopped working.

- Configuration : The settings or arragement of a system, service, or software that controls how it behave.

- Integrity : Making sure data is correct, complete, and not changed in an unauthorized or unexpected way.

- Unauthorized : Not allowed, not approved, or no permission to do something.

- Ephemeral : Something that exists only for a short time and then disappears.

- Buffer : A temporary area in memory used to hold data while it's being moved, processed, or transferred.

- Replication : Copying data or resources from one place to another, usually to improve availability, durability, and performance.

- Cache : A temporary storage area that saves data so it can be quickly accessed later — without reloading.

- Scratch data : This is a useful term in Cloud, computing, and temporary storage contexts.

- High-throughput : The ability to process or transfer a large amount data or requests in a short peroid of time.

- Mission-critical : A system, application, or process that is essential to the success or operation of a bussiness - if it fails, it causes major damage or downtime.

- Intensive workloads : Tasks or applications that require a lot of system resources, such as CPU, memory(RAM), disk I/O, or network bandwidth. 

- Burst : A short period of extra performance or speed that goes beyond the usual limit.

- Sustained : Something that is maintained continuously over time - not temporary or short burst.

- Consistency : Making sure that data stays the same (correct and up-to-date) across all systems or locations.

- Sub-millisecond : a time delay or response time that is less than 1 millisecoond (ms) - 1 millisecond = 1/1000 of a second.

- Optimized : Something has been improved or tuned to perform better - usually in terms of speed, cost, resource usage, or efficiency.

- Concurrent : Happening at the same time.

- Decryption : The process of unlocking encrypted data so it can be read or used again.

- Leverage : To use something effectively to gain an advantage or achieve a goal.

- Protocal : A set of rules or standards that define how data is sent, revised, and understood between devices, systems, or applications.

- Compatible : Able to work together correctly without problems or conflicts.

- Conflict : When two or more things try to happen at the same time or in the same place, and they don't work together - causing an error, crash, or unexpected behavior.

- Petabyte-scale : A system,service, or architecture that is designed to handle, store, or process data in the petabyte (PB) range - that's 1,000 terabytes or 1 million gigabytes.

- Sensitive : Something that is private, confidential, or easily affected - and needs extra protection or careful handling.

- Parallel : Multiple tasks or processes happening at the exact same time, usually on separate CPUs, cores, or machines.

- Provisioned : To set up, allocate, and prepare resources (like servers, databases, or storage) so they are ready to use.

- Retrieve : To get something back, especially data or information that is stored somewhere.

- Durablilty : The ability of data to last over time without being lost, corrupted, or deleted unexpectedly.

- Corrupted : Damaged broken, or changed in a bad way, so the data no longer works or is unreadable.

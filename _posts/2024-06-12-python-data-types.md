## What is Python?
- Python is an interpreter language developed by Guido van Rossum in Amsterdam in 1990. He named it after his favorite comedy show, Monty python's flying circus.     
- Python programs are very easy and convenient to collaborate and maintain. Because of this, many programs written in other languages are already being rewritten in Python.      
> An interpreter language is a language that interprets source code line by line and can be executed on the fly to see the results.

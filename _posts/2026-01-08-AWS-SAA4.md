# 1. EBS Overview
## What's an EBS Volume?
- An EBS (Elastic Block Store)Volume is a network drive you can attach to your instance while they run
- It allows your instance to persis data, even after their termination
- They can only be mounted to one instance at a time
- They are bound to a specific availability zone
- Analoy : Think of them as a "network USB stick"

## EBS Volume
- It's a network drive
  - It uses the network to communicate the instance, which means there might be a bit of latency
  - It can be detached from an EC2 instance and attached to another one quickly
- It's locked to an Availability Zone (AZ)
  - An EBS Volume in us-east-l a cannot be attached to us-east-lb
  - To move a volume across, you first need to snapshot it
- Have a provisioned capacity (size in GBs, and IOPS)
  - You get billed for all the provisioned capacity
  - You can increase the capacity of the drive over time

## EBS - Delete on Termination attribute
- Controls the EBS behaviour when an EC2 instance terminates
  - By default, the root EBS volume is deleted (attribute enabled)
  - By default, any other attached EBS volume is not deleted (attribute disabled)
- This can be controlled by the AWS console / AWS CLI
- Use case : preserve root volume when instance is terminated

# 2. EBS Snapshots
## EBS Snapshots
- Make a backup (snapshot) of your EBS volume at a point in time
- Not necessary to detach volume to do snapshot, but recommended
- Can copy snapshots across AZ or Region

## EBS Snapshots Features
- EBS Snapshot Archive
  - Move a Snapshot to an "archive tier" that is 75% cheaper
  - Takes within 24 to 72 hours for restoring the archive
- Recycle Bine for EBS Snapshots
  - Setup rules to retain deleted snapshotes so you can recover them after an accidental deletion
  - Specify retention (from day to year)
- Fast Snapshot Restore (FSR)
  - Force full initialization of snapshot to have no latency on the first use (spending money)

# 3. AMI Overview
## AMI Overview
- AMI = Amazon Machine Image
- AMI are a customization of an EC2 instance
  - You add your own software, configuration, operating system, monitoring...
  - Faster boot / configuration time because all your software is pre-packaged
- AMI are built for a specific region (and can be copied across regions)
- You can launch EC2 instance from :
  - A Public AMI : you make and maintain them yourself
  - An AWS Marketplace AMI : an AMI someone else made (and potentially sells) 

## AMI Process (from an EC2 instance)
- Start an EC2 instance and customize it
- Stop the instance (for data integrity)
- Build an AMI - this will also create EBS snapshots
- Launch instance from other AMIs

## EC2 Instance Store
- EBS volumes are network drives with good but "limited" performance
- If you need a high-performance hardware disk, use EC2 Instance Store
- Better I/O performance
- EC2 Instance Store lose their storage if they're stopped (ephemeral)
- Good for buffer / cache / scratch data/ temporary content
- Risk of data loss if hardware fails
- Backups and Replication are your responsibility

# 4. EBS Volume Types
## EBS Volume Types
- EBS Volumes come in 6 types
  - gp2 / gp3 (SSD) : General purpose SSD volume that balances price and performance for a wide variety of workloads
  - io 1 / io2 Block Express (SSD) : Highest-performance SSD volume for mission-critical low-latency or high-throughput workloads
  - st 1 (HDD) : Low cost HDD volume designed for frequently accessed, throughput-intensive workloads
  - sc 1 (HDD) : Lowest cost HDD volume designed for less frequently accessed workloads
- EBS Volumes are characterized in Size / Throughput / IOPS (I/O Ops Per Sec)
- When in doubt always consult the AWS documentation - it's good
- Only gp2/gp3 and io1/io2 Block Express cna be used as boot volumes

## EBS Volumes Types Use Cases General Purpose SSD
- Cost effective storage, low-latency
- System boot volumes, Virtual desktops, Development and test environments
- 1 Gib - 16 TiB
- gp3 : 
  - Baseline of 3,000 IOPS and throughput of 125 MiB/s
  - Can increase IOPS up to 16,000 and throughput up to 1,000 MiB/s independently
- gp2 :
  - Small gp2 volumes can burst IOPS to 3,000
  - Size of the volumes and IOPS are linked, max IOPS is 16,000
  - 3 IOPS per GiB, means at 5,334 GiB we are at the max IOPS

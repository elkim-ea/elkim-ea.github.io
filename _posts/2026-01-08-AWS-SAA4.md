# 1. EBS Overview
## What's an EBS Volume?
- An EBS (Elastic Block Store)Volume is a network drive you can attach to your instance while they run
- It allows your instance to persis data, even after their termination
- They can only be mounted to one instance at a time
- They are bound to a specific availability zone
- Analoy : Think of them as a "network USB stick"

## EBS Volume
- It's a network drive
  - It uses the network to communicate the instance, which means there might be a bit of latency
  - It can be detached from an EC2 instance and attached to another one quickly
- It's locked to an Availability Zone (AZ)
  - An EBS Volume in us-east-l a cannot be attached to us-east-lb
  - To move a volume across, you first need to snapshot it
- Have a provisioned capacity (size in GBs, and IOPS)
  - You get billed for all the provisioned capacity
  - You can increase the capacity of the drive over time

## EBS - Delete on Termination attribute
- Controls the EBS behaviour when an EC2 instance terminates
  - By default, the root EBS volume is deleted (attribute enabled)
  - By default, any other attached EBS volume is not deleted (attribute disabled)
- This can be controlled by the AWS console / AWS CLI
- Use case : preserve root volume when instance is terminated

# 2. EBS Snapshots
## EBS Snapshots
- Make a backup (snapshot) of your EBS volume at a point in time
- Not necessary to detach volume to do snapshot, but recommended
- Can copy snapshots across AZ or Region

## EBS Snapshots Features
- EBS Snapshot Archive
  - Move a Snapshot to an "archive tier" that is 75% cheaper
  - Takes within 24 to 72 hours for restoring the archive
- Recycle Bine for EBS Snapshots
  - Setup rules to retain deleted snapshotes so you can recover them after an accidental deletion
  - Specify retention (from day to year)
- Fast Snapshot Restore (FSR)
  - Force full initialization of snapshot to have no latency on the first use (spending money)

# 3. AMI Overview
## AMI Overview
- AMI = Amazon Machine Image
- AMI are a customization of an EC2 instance
  - You add your own software, configuration, operating system, monitoring...
  - Faster boot / configuration time because all your software is pre-packaged
- AMI are built for a specific region (and can be copied across regions)
- You can launch EC2 instance from :
  - A Public AMI : you make and maintain them yourself
  - An AWS Marketplace AMI : an AMI someone else madee (and potentially sells) 

## AMI Process (ffrom an EC2 instance)
- Start an EC2

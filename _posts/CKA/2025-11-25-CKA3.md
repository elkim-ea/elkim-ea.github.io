Create a new Deployment using the deployment-definition-1.yaml file located at /root/.


There is an issue with the file, so try to fix it.

```bash 
kubectl create -f deployment-definition-1.yaml

vi deployment-definition-1.yaml
```

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: deployment -> Deployment
metadata:
  name: deployment-1
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      name: busybox-pod
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        name: busybox-pod
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: busybox-container
        image: busybox
        command:
        - sh
        - "-c"
        - echo Hello Kubernetes! && sleep 3600
```

```bash 
kubectl create -f deployment-definition-1.yaml
```

Create a new Deployment with the below attributes using your own deployment definition file.

Replicas: 3;
Image: httpd:2.4-alpine

```bash 
kubectl create deployment --help

kubectl create deployment httpd-frontend --image=httpd:2.4-alpine --replicas=3
```

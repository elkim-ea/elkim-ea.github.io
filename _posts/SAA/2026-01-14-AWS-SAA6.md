# 1. Amazon RDS Overview
## Amazon RDS Overview
- RDS stands for Relational Database Service
- It's a managed DB service for DB use SQL as a query language
- It allows you to create databases in the cloud that are managed by AWS
  - Postgres
  - MySQL
  - MariaDB
  - Oracle
  - Microsoft SQL Server
  - IBM DB2
  - Aurora (AWS Proprietary Database)

## Advantage over using RDS versus deploying DB on EC2
- RDS is a managed service : 
  - Automated provisioning, OS patching
  - Continuous backups and restore to specific timestamp (Point in Time Restore)
  - Monitoring dashboards
  - Read replicas for improved read performance
  - Multi AZ setup for DR (Disaster Recovery)
  - Maintenance windows for upgrades
  - Scaling capability (vertical and horizontal)
  - Storage backed by EBS
- BUT you can't SSH into your instances

## RDS - Storage Auto Scaling
- Hepls you increase storage on your RDS DB instance dynamically
- When RDS detects you are running out od free database storage, it scales automatically
- Avoid manually scaling your database storage
- You have to set Maximum Storage Threshold (maximum limit for DB storage)
- Automatically modify storage if : 
  - Free stroage is less than 10% of allocated storage
  - Low-storage lasts at least 5 minutes
  - 6 hours have passed since last modification
- Useful for applicatins with unpredictable workloads
- Support all RDS database engines

# 2. RDS Read Replicas vs Multi AZ
## RDS Read Replicas for read scalability
- Up to 15 Read Replicas
- Within AZ, Cross AZ or Cross Region
- Replication is ASYNC, so reads are eventually consistent
- Replicas can be promoted to their own DB
- Applications must update the connection string to leverage read replicas

<img src="{{ '/assets/img/images/aws/RDSREADREplicas for read scalability.png' | relative_url }}" alt="스크린샷" width="300"> 

## RDS Read Replicas - Use Cases
- You have a production database that is taking on normal load
- You want to run a reporting application to run some analytics
- You create a Read Replica to run the new workload there
- The production application is unaffected
- Read replicas are used for SELECT (= read) only kind of statements (not INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)

<img src="{{ '/assets/img/images/aws/RDSREADREplicas-UseCases.png' | relative_url }}" alt="스크린샷" width="300"> 

## RDS Read Replicas - Network Cost
- In AWS there's a network cost when data goes from one AZ to another
- For RDS Read Replicas within the same region, you don't pay that fee

<img src="{{ '/assets/img/images/aws/RDSREADREplicas-NetworkCost.png' | relative_url }}" alt="스크린샷" width="300"> 

## RDS Multi AZ (Disaster Recovery)
- SYNC replication
- One DNS name - automatic app failover to standby
- Increase availability
- Failover in case of loss of AZ, loss of network, instance or storage failure
- No manual intervention in apps
- Not used for scaling

- Note : The Read Replicas be setup as Multi AZ for Disaster Recovery (DR)

<img src="{{ '/assets/img/images/aws/RDSMultiAZ-DisasterRecovery.png' | relative_url }}" alt="스크린샷" width="300"> 

## RDS - From Single - AZ to Multi - AZ
- Zero downtime operation (no need to stop the DB)
- Just click on "modify" for the database
- The following happens internally :
  - A snapshot is taken
  - A new DB is restored from the snapshot in a new AZ
  - synchronization is established between the two databases

<img src="{{ '/assets/img/images/aws/RDS-FromSingle-AZtoMulti-AZ.png' | relative_url }}" alt="스크린샷" width="300"> 

# 3. RDS Custom for Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server
## RDS custom
- Managed Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server Database with OS and database customization
- RDS : Automates setup, operation, and scaling of database in AWS
- Custom : access to the underlying database and OS so you can
  - Configure setting
  - Install patches
  - Enable native features
  - Access the inderlying EC2 Instance using SSH or SSM Session Manager
- De-activate Automation Mode to perform your customization, better to take a DB snapshot before
- RDS vs RDS Custom
  - RDS : entire database and the OS to be managed by AWS
  - RDS Custom : full admin access to the underlying OS and the database

# 4. Amazon Aurora
## Amazon Aurora
- Aurora is a proprietary technology from AWS (not open sourced)
- Postgres and MySQL are both supported as Aurora DB (that means your drivers will work as if Aurora was a Postgres or MySQL database)
- Aurora is "AWS clod optimized" and claims 5x performance improvement over MySQL on RDS, over 3x the performance of Postgres on RDS
- Aurora storage automatically grows in increments of 10GB, up to 256 TB
- Aurora can have up to 15 replicas and the replication process is faster than MySQL (sub 10 ms replica lag)
- Failover in Aurora is instantaneous It's HA native
- Aurora costs more than RDS (20% more) - but is more efficient

## Aurora High Availability and REad Scaling
- 6 copies of your data across 3 AZ : 
  - 4 copies out of 6 needed for writes
  - 3 copies out of 6 need for reads
  - Self healing with peer-to-peer replication
  - Storage is striped across 100s of volumes
- One Aurora Instance takes writes (master)
- Automated failover for master in less than 30 seconds
- Master + up to 15 Aurora Read Replicas serve reads
- Support for Cross Region Replication

## Aurora DB Cluster

<img src="{{ '/assets/img/images/aws/AuroraDBCluster.png' | relative_url }}" alt="스크린샷" width="300"> 

## Feature of Aurora
- Automatic fail-over
- Backup and Recovery
- Isolation and Security
- Industry compliance
- Push-button scaling
- Automated Patching with Zero Downtime
- Advanced Monitoring
- Routine Maintenance
- Backtrack : restore data at any point of time without using backups

# 5. Amazon Aurora - advanced Concepts
## Amazon Aurora - Auto Scaling

<img src="{{ '/assets/img/images/aws/AuroraReplicas-AutoScaling.png' | relative_url }}" alt="스크린샷" width="300"> 

## Aurora - Custom Endpoints
- Define a subnet of Aurora Instances as a Custom Endpoint
- Example : Run analytical queries on specific replicas
- The Reader Endpoint is generally not used after defining Custom Endpoints

<img src="{{ '/assets/img/images/aws/Aurora-CustomEndpoint.png' | relative_url }}" alt="스크린샷" width="300"> 

## Aurora Serverless
- Automated database instantitation and auto-scaling based on actual usage
- Good for infrequent, intermittent or unpredictable workloads
- No capacity planning needed
- Pay per second, can be more cost-effective

<img src="{{ '/assets/img/images/aws/AuroraServerless.png' | relative_url }}" alt="스크린샷" width="300"> 

## Global Aurora
- Aurora Cross Region Read Replicas : 
  - Useful for disaster recovery
  - Simple to put in place
- Aurora Global Database (recommended) :
  - I Primary Region (read / write)
  - Up to 10 secondary (read-only) regions, replication lag is less than 1 second
  - Up to 16 Read Replicas per secondary region
  - Helps for decreasing latency
  - Promoting another region (for disaster recovery) has an RTO of < 1 minute
  - Typical cross-region replication takes less than 1 second

  <img src="{{ '/assets/img/images/aws/GlobalAurora.png' | relative_url }}" alt="스크린샷" width="300"> 

  ## Aurora Machine Learning
  - Enable you to add ML-based predictions to your applications via SQL
  - Simple, optimized, add secure integration between Aurora and AWS ML services
  - Supported services
    - Amazon SageMaker (use with any ML model)
    - Amazon Comprehend (for sentiment analysis)
  - You don't need to have ML experience
  - Use cases : fraud detection, ads targeting, sentiment analysis, product recommendations

<img src="{{ '/assets/img/images/aws/AuroraMachineLearning.png' | relative_url }}" alt="스크린샷" width="300"> 

## Babelfish for Aurora PostgreSQL
- Allows Aurora PostgreSQL to understand commands targeted for MS SQL Server (e.g, T-SQL)
- Therefore Microsoft SQL Server based applications can work on Aurora PostgreSQL
- Requires no to little code changes (using the same MS SQL Server client driver)
- The same applications can be used after a migration of your database (using AWS SCT and DMS)

# 6. RDS & Aurora - Backup and Monitoring
## RDS Backups
- Automated backups :
  - Daily full backup of the database (during the backup window)
  - Transaction logs are backed-up by RDS every 5 minutes
  - => ability to restore to any point in time (from oldest backup to 5 minutes ago)
  - 1 to 3 days of retention, set 0 to disable automated backups
- Manual DB Snapshots
  - Manually triggered by the user
  - Retention of backup for as long as you want
- Trick : in a stopped RDS database, you will still pay for storage. If you plan on stopping it for a long time, you should snapshot & restore instead

## Aurora Backups
- Automated backups
  - 1 to 35 days (cannot be disabled)
  - point-in-time recovery in that timeframe
- Manual DB Snapshots
  - Manually triggered by the user
  - Retention of backup for as long as you want

## RDS Aurora Restore options
- Restoring a RDS / Aurora backup or a snapshot create a new database
- Restoring MySQL RDS database from S3
  - Create a backup of your on-premises database
  - Store it on Amazon S3 (object storage)
  - Restore the backup file onto a new RDS instance running MyySQL
- Restoring MySQL Aurora cluster from S3
  - Create a backup of your on-premises database using Percona XtraBackup
  - Store the backup file on Amazon S3
  - Restore the backup file onto a new Aurora cluster running MySQL

## Aurora Database Cloning
- Create a new Aurora DB Cluster from an existing one
- Faster than snapshot & restore
- Uses copy-on-write protocol
  - Initially, the new DB cluster uses the same data volume as the original DB cluster (fast and efficient - no copying is needed)
  - When updates are made to the new BD cluster data is copied to be separated
- Very fast & cost-effective
- Useful to create a "staging" database from a "production" database without impacting the production database

# 7. RDS Security
## RDS & Aurora Security
- At-rest encryption :
  - Database master & replicas encryption using AWS KMS - must be defined as launch time
  - If the master is not encrypted, the read replicas cannot be encrypted
  - To encrypt an un-encrypted database, go through a DB snapshot & restore as encrypted
- In-flight-encryption : TLS-ready by default, use the AWS TLS root certificates client-side
- IAM Authentication : IAM roles to connect to your database (instead of username/pw)
- Security Groups : Control Network access to your RDS / Aurora DB
- No SSH available except on RDS Custom
- Audit Logs can be enabled and sent to CloudWatch Logs for longer retention

# 8. RDS Proxy
## Amazon RDS Proxy
- Fully managed database proxy for RDS
- Allows apps to pool and share DB connections established with the database
- Improving database efficiency by reducing the stress on database resources (e.g, CPU, RAM) and minimize open connections (and timeout)
- Serverless, autoscaling, highly available (Multi-AZ)
- Reduced RDS & Aurora failover time by up 66%
- Supports RDS (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, MS SQL Server) and Aurora (MySQL, PostgreSQL)
- No code changes required for most apps
- Enforce IAM Authentication for DB, and securely store credentials in AWS Secrets Manager
- RDS Proxy is never publicly accessible (must be accessed from VPC)

# 9. ElastiCache Overview
## Amazon ElastiCache Overview
- The same way RDS is to get managed Relational Databases...
- ElastiCache is to get managed Redis or Memcached
- Caches are in-memory databases with really high performance, low latency
- Helps reduce load off of databasess for read intensive workloads
- Helps make your application stateless
- AWS takes care of OS maintenance / patching,optimizations, setup, configuration, monitoring, failure recovery and backups
- Using ElastiCache involves heavy application code changes

## ElasticCache Solution Architecture - DB Cache
- Applications queries ElastiCache, if not available, get from RDS and store in ElastiCache
- Helps relieve load in RDS
- Cache must have an invalidation strategy to must sure only the most current data is used in there

<img src="{{ '/assets/img/images/aws/ElasticCache Solution Architecture-DBCache.png' | relative_url }}" alt="스크린샷" width="300">

## ElasticCache Solution Architecture - User Session Store
- User logs into any of the application
- The application writes the session data into ElastiCache
- The user hits another instance of our application
- The instance retrieves the data and user is already logged in

<img src="{{ '/assets/img/images/aws/ElasticCache Solution Architecture - User Session Store.png' | relative_url }}" alt="스크린샷" width="300">

## ElasticCache - Redis vs Memcached

<img src="{{ '/assets/img/images/aws/ElasticCache - Redis vs Memcached.png' | relative_url }}" alt="스크린샷" width="300">

# 10. ElasticCache for Solution Architects
## ElasticCache - Cache Security
- ELastiCache supports IAM Authentication for Redis
- IAM policies on ElastiCache are only used for AWS API-level security
- Redis AUTH
  - You can set a "password.token" when you create a Redis cluster
  - This is an extra level of security for your cache (on top of security groups)
  - Support SSL in flight encryption
- Memcached
  - Supports SASL-based authentication (advanced)

<img src="{{ '/assets/img/images/aws/ElasticCache - Cache Security.png' | relative_url }}" alt="스크린샷" width="300">

## Patterns for ElastiCache
- Lazy Loading : all the read data is cached, data can become stale in cache
- Write Through : Adds or update data in the cache when written to a DB (no stale data)
- Session Store : store temporary session data in a cache (using TTL features)
- Quote : there are only two hard things in Computer Science : cache invalidation and naming things

# 11. List Ports to be familiar with
Here's a list of standard ports you should see at least once. You shouldn't remember them (the exam will not test you on that), but you should be able to differentiate between an Important (HTTPS - port 443) and a database port (PostgreSQL - port 5432) 

Important ports:
- FTP: 21
- SSH: 22
- SFTP: 22 (same as SSH)
- HTTP: 80
- HTTPS: 443

vs RDS Databases ports:
- PostgreSQL: 5432
- MySQL: 3306
- Oracle RDS: 1521
- MSSQL Server: 1433
- MariaDB: 3306 (same as MySQL)
- Aurora: 5432 (if PostgreSQL compatible) or 3306 (if MySQL compatible)

> Don't stress out on remember those, just read that list once today and once before going into the exam and you should be all set :)
> Remember, you should just be able to differentiate an "Important Port" vs an "RDS database Port".

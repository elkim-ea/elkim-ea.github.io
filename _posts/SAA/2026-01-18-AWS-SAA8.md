# 1. Solutions Architecture Discussions Overview
## Section Introduction
- These solutions architectures are the beat part of this course
- Let's understand how all the technologies we've seen work together
- This is a section you need to be 100% comfortable with
- We'll see the progression of a Solution's architect mindset through many sample case studies : 
  - WhatlsTheTime.Com
  - MyClothes.Com
  - MyWordPress.Com
  - Instantiating Applications quickly
  - Beanstalk

# 2. WhatlsTheTime.com
## Stateless Web App : WhatlsTheTime.com
- WhatlsTheTime.com allows people to know what time it is 
- We don't need a database
- We want to start small and can accept downtime
- We want to fully scale vertically and horizontally, no downtime
- Let's go through the Solutions Architect journey for this app
- Let's see how we can proceed

## Stateless web app : What time is it? Starting simple

<img src="{{ '/assets/img/images/aws/Minimum 2 AZ = Lets reserve capacity.png' | relative_url }}" alt="스크린샷" width="300">

## In this lecture we've discussed ...
- Public vs Private IP and EC2 instances
- Elastic IP vs Route 53 vs Load Balancers
- Route 53 TTL, A records and Alias Records
- Maintaining EC2 instances manually vs Auto Scaling Groups
- Multi AZ to survive disasters
- ELB Health Checks
- Security Group Rules
- Reservation of capacity for costing savings when possible

# 3. MyClothes.com
## Stateful Web App : MyCloths.com
- MyClothes.com allows people to buy clothes online
- There's a shopping cart
- Our website is having hundreds of users at the same time
- We need to scale, maintain horizontal scalability and keep our web application as stateless as possible
- Users should not losse their shopping cart
- Users should have their details (address, etc) in a database

## Stateful Web App : MyClothes.com

## In this Lecture we've discussed ... 3-tier architectures for web applications
- ELB sticky sessions
- Web clients for storing cookies and making our web app stateless
- ElastiCache
  - For storing sessions (alternative : DynamoDB)
  - For caching data from RDS
  - Multi AZ
- RDS
  - For storing user data
  - Read replicas for scaling reads
  - Multi AZ for disaster recovery
- Tight Security with security groups referencing each other

- Storing data in EBS (single instance application)
- Vs storing data in EFS (diistributed application)

# 5. Instantiating applications quickly
## Instantiating Applications quickly
- When launching a full stack (EC2, EBS, RDS), it can take time to :
  - Install applications
  - Insert initial (or recovery) data
  - Configure everything
  - Launch the application
- We can take advantage of the cloud to speed that up
- EC2 Instances : 
  - Use a Golden AMI : Install your applications, OS dependencies etc.. beforehand and launch your EC2 instance from the Golden AMI
  - Bootstrap using User Data : For dynamic configuration, use User Data scripts
  - Hybrid : mix Golden AMI and User Data (Elastic Beanstalk)
- RDS Databases : 
  - Restore from a snapshot : the database will have schenas and data ready
- EBS Volumes :
  - Restore from a snapshot : the disk will already be formatted and have data

# 6. Beanstalk Overview
## Typical architecture : Web App 3-tier

<img src="{{ '/assets/img/images/aws/Typical architecture Web App 3-tier.png' | relative_url }}" alt="스크린샷" width="300">

## Developer problems on AWS
- Managing infrastructure
- Deploying Code
- Configuring all the databases, load balancers, etc
- Scaling concerns
- Most web apps have the same architecture (ALB + ASG)
- All the devlopers want is for their code to run
- Possibly, consistently across different applications and environments

## Elastic Beanstalk - Overview
- Elastic Beanstalk is a developer centric view of deploying an application on AWS
- It uses all the component's we've seen before : EC2, ASG, ELB, RDS, ...
- Managed service
  - Automatically handles capacity provisioning, load balancinf, scaling, application health monitoring, instance configuration,...
  - Just the application code is the responsibility of the developer
- We still have full control over the configuration
- Beanstalk is free but you pay for the underlying instances

## Elastic Beanstalk - Components
- Application : collection of Elastic Beanstalk components (environments, versions, configurations,...)
- Application Version : an iteration of your application code
- Environment
  - Collection od AWS resources running an application version (only one application version at a time)
  - Tiers : Web Server Environment Tier & Worker Envionment Tier
  - You can create multiple environments (dev, test, prod, ...)

## Elastic Beanstalk - Supported Platforms
- Go
- Java SE
- Java with Tomcat
- .NET Core on Linux
- .NET on Windows Server
- Node.js
- PHP
- Python
- Ruby
- Packer Builder
- Single Container Docker
- Multi-container Docker
- Preconfigured Docker

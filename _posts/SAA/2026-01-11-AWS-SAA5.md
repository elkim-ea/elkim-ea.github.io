# 1. High Availability and Scalability 
## Scalability & High Availability
- Scalability means that an application / system can handle greater loads by adapting
- There are two kinds of scalability : 
  - Vertical Scalability
  - Horizontal Scalability (= elasticity)
- Scalability is linked but different to High Availability

## Vertical Scalability
- Vertically scalability means increasing the size of the instance
- For example, your application runs on a t2.micro
- Scaling that application vertically means running it on a t2.large
- Vertical scalability is very common for non distributed systems, such as a database
- RDS, ElastiCache are services that can scale vertically
- There's usually a limit to how much you can vertically scale (hardware limit)

## Horizontal Scalability
- Horizontal Scalability menas increasing the number of instances / systems for your application
- Horizontal scaling implies distributed systems
- This is very common for web applications / modern applications
- It's easy to horizontally scale thanks the cloud offerings such as Amazon EC2

## High Availability
- High availability usually goes hand in hand with horizontal scaling
- High availability means running your application / system in at least 2 data centers (== availability zones)
- The goal of high availability is to survive a data center loss
- The high availability can be passive (for RDS Multi AZ)
- The high availability can be active (for horizontal scaling)

## High Availability & Scalability For EC2
- Vertical Scaling : Increase instance size (= scale up / down)
  - From: t2.nano - 0.5G og RAM, 1 vCPU
  - To : u- 12tb 1.metal - 12.3 TB of RAM, 448 vCPUs
- Horizontal Scaling : Increase number of instance ( = scale out / in)
  - Auto Scaling Group
  - Load Balancer
- High Availability : Run instances for the same application across multi AZ
  - Auto Scaling Group multi AZ
  - Load Balancer multi AZ

# 2. Elastic Load Balancing(ELB) Overview
## What is Load Balancing?
- Load Balances are servers that forward traffic to multiple servers (e.g., EC2 instances) downstream

## Why use a load balancer?
- Spread load across multiple downstream instances
- Expose a single point of access (DNS) to youor application
- Seamlessly handle failures of downstream instances
- Do regular health checks to your instances
- Provide SSL termination (HTTPS) for your websites
- Enforce stickiness with cookies
- High availability across zones
- Separate public traffic from private traffic

## Why use an Elastic Load Balancer?
- An Elastic Load Balancer is a managed load balancer
  - AWS guarantees that it will be working
  - AWS takes care of upgrades, maintenance, high availability
  - AWS provides only a few configuration knobs
- It costs less to setup your own load balancer but it will be a lot of more effort on your end
- It is integrated with many AWS offering / services
  - EC2, EC2 Auto Scaling Groups. Amazon ECS
  - AWS Certificate Manager (ACM), CloudWatch
  - Route 53, AWS WAF, AWS Global Accelerator

## Health Checks
- Health Ckecks are crucial for Load Balancers
- They enable the load balancer to know if instances it forwards traffic to are available to reply to requests
- The health ckeck is done on a port and a route (/health is common)
- If the response is not 200 (OK), then the instance is unhealthy

## Types of load balancer on AWS
- AWS has 4 kinds of managed Load Balancers
- Classic Load Balancer (v1 - old generation) - 2009 - CLB
  - HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, SSL (secure TCP)
- Application Load Balancer (v2 - new generation) - 2016 - ALB
  - HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket
- Network Load Balancer (v2 - new generation) - 2017 - NLB
  - TCP, TLS (secure TCP), UDP
- Gateway Load Balancer - 2020 - GWLB
  - Operates at layer 3 (Network layer) - IP Protocol

> Overall, it is recommended to use the newer generation load balancers as they provide more features
> Some load balancers can be setup as internal (private) or external (public) ELBs

# 1. High Availability and Scalability 
## Scalability & High Availability
- Scalability means that an application / system can handle greater loads by adapting
- There are two kinds of scalability : 
  - Vertical Scalability
  - Horizontal Scalability (= elasticity)
- Scalability is linked but different to High Availability

## Vertical Scalability
- Vertically scalability means increasing the size of the instance
- For example, your application runs on a t2.micro
- Scaling that application vertically means running it on a t2.large
- Vertical scalability is very common for non distributed systems, such as a database
- RDS, ElastiCache are services that can scale vertically
- There's usually a limit to how much you can vertically scale (hardware limit)

## Horizontal Scalability
- Horizontal Scalability menas increasing the number of instances / systems for your application
- Horizontal scaling implies distributed systems
- This is very common for web applications / modern applications
- It's easy to horizontally scale thanks the cloud offerings such as Amazon EC2

## High Availability
- High availability usually goes hand in hand with horizontal scaling
- High availability means running your application / system in at least 2 data centers (== availability zones)
- The goal of high availability is to survive a data center loss
- The high availability can be passive (for RDS Multi AZ)
- The high availability can be active (for horizontal scaling)

## High Availability & Scalability For EC2
- Vertical Scaling : Increase instance size (= scale up / down)
  - From: t2.nano - 0.5G og RAM, 1 vCPU
  - To : u- 12tb 1.metal - 12.3 TB of RAM, 448 vCPUs
- Horizontal Scaling : Increase number of instance ( = scale out / in)
  - Auto Scaling Group
  - Load Balancer
- High Availability : Run instances for the same application across multi AZ
  - Auto Scaling Group multi AZ
  - Load Balancer multi AZ

# 2. Elastic Load Balancing(ELB) Overview
## What is Load Balancing?
- Load Balances are servers that forward traffic to multiple servers (e.g., EC2 instances) downstream

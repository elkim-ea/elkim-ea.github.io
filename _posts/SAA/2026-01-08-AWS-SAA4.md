# 1. EBS Overview
## What's an EBS Volume?
- An EBS (Elastic Block Store)Volume is a network drive you can attach to your instance while they run
- It allows your instance to persis data, even after their termination
- They can only be mounted to one instance at a time
- They are bound to a specific availability zone
- Analoy : Think of them as a "network USB stick"

## EBS Volume
- It's a network drive
  - It uses the network to communicate the instance, which means there might be a bit of latency
  - It can be detached from an EC2 instance and attached to another one quickly
- It's locked to an Availability Zone (AZ)
  - An EBS Volume in us-east-l a cannot be attached to us-east-lb
  - To move a volume across, you first need to snapshot it
- Have a provisioned capacity (size in GBs, and IOPS)
  - You get billed for all the provisioned capacity
  - You can increase the capacity of the drive over time

## EBS - Delete on Termination attribute
- Controls the EBS behaviour when an EC2 instance terminates
  - By default, the root EBS volume is deleted (attribute enabled)
  - By default, any other attached EBS volume is not deleted (attribute disabled)
- This can be controlled by the AWS console / AWS CLI
- Use case : preserve root volume when instance is terminated

# 2. EBS Snapshots
## EBS Snapshots
- Make a backup (snapshot) of your EBS volume at a point in time
- Not necessary to detach volume to do snapshot, but recommended
- Can copy snapshots across AZ or Region

## EBS Snapshots Features
- EBS Snapshot Archive
  - Move a Snapshot to an "archive tier" that is 75% cheaper
  - Takes within 24 to 72 hours for restoring the archive
- Recycle Bine for EBS Snapshots
  - Setup rules to retain deleted snapshotes so you can recover them after an accidental deletion
  - Specify retention (from day to year)
- Fast Snapshot Restore (FSR)
  - Force full initialization of snapshot to have no latency on the first use (spending money)

# 3. AMI Overview
## AMI Overview
- AMI = Amazon Machine Image
- AMI are a customization of an EC2 instance
  - You add your own software, configuration, operating system, monitoring...
  - Faster boot / configuration time because all your software is pre-packaged
- AMI are built for a specific region (and can be copied across regions)
- You can launch EC2 instance from :
  - A Public AMI : you make and maintain them yourself
  - An AWS Marketplace AMI : an AMI someone else made (and potentially sells) 

## AMI Process (from an EC2 instance)
- Start an EC2 instance and customize it
- Stop the instance (for data integrity)
- Build an AMI - this will also create EBS snapshots
- Launch instance from other AMIs

## EC2 Instance Store
- EBS volumes are network drives with good but "limited" performance
- If you need a high-performance hardware disk, use EC2 Instance Store
- Better I/O performance
- EC2 Instance Store lose their storage if they're stopped (ephemeral)
- Good for buffer / cache / scratch data/ temporary content
- Risk of data loss if hardware fails
- Backups and Replication are your responsibility

# 4. EBS Volume Types
## EBS Volume Types
- EBS Volumes come in 6 types
  - gp2 / gp3 (SSD) : General purpose SSD volume that balances price and performance for a wide variety of workloads
  - io 1 / io2 Block Express (SSD) : Highest-performance SSD volume for mission-critical low-latency or high-throughput workloads
  - st 1 (HDD) : Low cost HDD volume designed for frequently accessed, throughput-intensive workloads
  - sc 1 (HDD) : Lowest cost HDD volume designed for less frequently accessed workloads
- EBS Volumes are characterized in Size / Throughput / IOPS (I/O Ops Per Sec)
- When in doubt always consult the AWS documentation - it's good
- Only gp2/gp3 and io1/io2 Block Express cna be used as boot volumes

## EBS Volumes Types Use Cases General Purpose SSD
- Cost effective storage, low-latency
- System boot volumes, Virtual desktops, Development and test environments
- 1 Gib - 16 TiB
- gp3 : 
  - Baseline of 3,000 IOPS and throughput of 125 MiB/s
  - Can increase IOPS up to 16,000 and throughput up to 1,000 MiB/s independently
- gp2 :
  - Small gp2 volumes can burst IOPS to 3,000
  - Size of the volumes and IOPS are linked, max IOPS is 16,000
  - 3 IOPS per GiB, means at 5,334 GiB we are at the max IOPS

- Comparison Table

| Term | Abbreviation | Base (Calculation) | Total Bytes | Common Use |
| :--- | :---: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Megabyte** | **MB** | $1000^2$ | $1,000,000$ | Marketing, File size |
| **Mebibyte** | **MiB** | $1024^2$ | $1,048,576$ | OS, RAM, I/O Speed |
| **Gigabyte** | **GB** | $1000^3$ | $1,000,000,000$ | Hard Drive Labels |
| **Gibibyte** | **GiB** | $1024^3$ | $1,073,741,824$ | Windows Disk Space |
| **Terabyte** | **TB** | $1000^4$ | $1,000,000,000,000$ | Storage Capacity |
| **Tebibyte** | **TiB** | $1024^4$ | $1,099,511,627,776$ | Server Storage |

## EBS Volume Types Use Cases Provisioned IOPS (PIOPS) SSD
- Critical business applications with sustained IOPS performance
- Or applications that need more than 16,000 IOPS
- Great for database workloads (sensitive to storage perf and consistency)
- io 1 (4 GiB - 16 TiB) : 
  - Max PIOPS : 64,000 for Nitro EC2 instances & 32,000 for other
  - CAn increase PIOPS independently from storage size
- io2 Block Express (4 GiB - 64 TiB) :
  - Sub-millisecond latency
  - Max PIOPS : 256,000 with an IOPS : GiB ratio of 1,000 : 1
- Supports EBS Multi-attach

## EBS Volume Types Use Cases Hard Disk Drives (HDD)
- Cannot be a boot volume
- 125 GiB to 16 TiB
- Throughput Optimized HDD (st 1)
  - Big Data, Data Warehouses, Log Processing
  - Max throughput 500 MiB/s - max IOPS 500
- Cold HDD (sc 1) :
  - For data that is infrequently accessed
  - Scenarios where lowest cost is important
  - Max throughput 250 MiB/s - max IOPS 250

# 5. EBS Multi-Attach
## EBS Multi-Attach - io1/io2 family
- Attach the same EBS volume to multiple EC2 instances in the same AZ
- Each instance has full read & write permissions to the high-performance volume
- Use case : 
  - Achieve higher application availability in clustered Linux applications (ex:Teradata)
  - Applications must manage concurrent write operations
- Up to 16 EC2 Instance at a time
- Must use a file system that's cluster-aware (not XFS, EXT4,...)

# 6. EBS Encryption
## EBS Encryption
- When you create an encrypted EBS volume, you get the following : 
  - Data at rest is enerypted inside the volume
  - All the data in flight moving between the instance and the volume is encrypted
  - All snapshots are encrypted
  - All volumes created from the snapshot
- Encryption and decryption are handled transparently (you have nothing to do)
- Encryption has a minimal impact on latency
- EBS Encryption leverages keys from KMS (AES-256)
- Copying an unencrypted snapshot allows encryption
- Snapshots of encrypted volumes are encrypted

## Encryption : encrypt an unencrypted EBS volume
- Create an EBS snapshot of the volume
- Encrypt the EBS snapshot (using copy)
- Create new EBS volume from the snapshot (the volume will also be encrypted)
- Now you can attach the encrypted volume to the original instance

# 7. Amazon EFS
## Amazon EFS - Elastic File System
- Managed NFS (network file system) that can be mounted on many EC2
- EFS works with EC2 instance in multi-AZ
- Highly available, scalable, expensive (3x gp2), pay per use
- they can all connect at the same time

<img src="{{ '/assets/img/images/aws/EC2-EFS.png' | relative_url }}" alt="스크린샷" width="300"> 

- Use cases : content management, web serving, data sharing, Wordpress
- Uses NFSv4.1 protocol
- Uses security group to control access to EFS
- Compatible with Linux based AMI (not Windows)
- Encryption at rest using KMS
- POSIX file system (~ Linux) that has a standard file API
- File system scales automatically, pay-per-use, no capacity planning

## EFS - Performancs & Storage Classes
- EFS Scale
  - 1000s of concurrent NFS clients, 10 GB+ /s throughput
  - Grow to Petabyte-scale network file system, automatically
- Performance Mode (set at EFS creation time)
  - General Purpose (default) - latency-sensitive use cases ( web server, CMS,...)
  - Max I/O - higher latency, throughput, highly parallel (big data, media processing)
- Throughput Mode
   - Bursting - 1 TB = 50 MiB/s + burst of up to 100 MiB/s
   - Provisioned - set your throughput regardless of stroage size, ex : 1 GiB/s for 1 TB storage
   - Elastic - automatically scales throughput up or down based on your workloads
    - Up to 3 GiB/s for reads and I GiB/s for writes
    - Used for unpredictable workloads

## EFS - Storage Classes
- Storage Tiers (lifecycle management feature - move file after N days)
  - Standard : for frequently accessed files
  - Infrequent access (EFS-IA) : cost to retrieve files, lower price to store
  - Archive : rarely accessed data (few times each year), 50% cheaper
  - Implement lifecycle policies to move files between storage tiers
- Availability and durablilty
  - Standard : Multi-AZ, greate for prod
  - One Zone : One AZ, greate for dev, backup enabled by default, compatible with IA(EFS One Zone -IA)
- Over 90% in cost savings

# 8. EFS vs EBS
## EBS vs EFS - Elastic block Storage
- EBS volumes..
  - one instance (expect multi-attach io 1/ io 2)
  - are locked at the Availability Zone (AZ) level
  - gp 2 : IO increase if the disk size increases
  - GP 3 & io 1 : can increase IO independently
- To migrate an EBS volume across AZ
  - Take a snapshot
  - Restore the snapshot to another AZ
  - EBS backups use IO and you shouldn't run them while your application is handling a lot of traffic
- Root EBS Volumes of instance get terminated by default if the EC2 instance gets terminated (you can disable that)

- EFS volumes...
- Mounting 100s of instances across AZ
- EFS share website files (WordPress)
- Only for Linux Instances (POSIX)
- EFS has a higher price point than EBS
- Can leverage Storage Tiers for cost savings
